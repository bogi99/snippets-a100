# profanity detector

* using the resource found at https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/bad-words.txt  https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/  Luis von Ahn, thanks and appreciation for the great collection. 

* simple php oop trait to detect the presence and the nature of the presented profanity with a dash of a singleton optimization to avoid reloading the bad-words file on every call.

* simple code snippet but can be pulled into a larger project to detect profanity in user provided posts and submitted form fields 

* this is for english only ( imho too strict ) would be nice if other languages where added to it , don't know, maybe french and german?
